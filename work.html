            Ooty (short for Udhagamandalam) is a resort town in the Western Ghats mountains, in southern India's Tamil Nadu state. Founded as a British Raj summer resort, it retains a working steam railway line. Other reminders of its colonial past include Stone House, a 19th-century residence, and the circa-1829 St. Stephen’s Church. Its 55-acre Government Botanical Garden lies on the slopes of Doddabetta Peak.

The best way to get to Ooty is to take the Nilgiri Mountain Railway, a quaint steam railway that offers superb views as it climbs the 2,286 metres (7,500 feet) to Ooty town centre. If you don’t fancy the train there are good road links through the mountains as well. 

Once in town you should explore the many colonial features left by the British. The Government Rose Garden is the largest in India, while the Ooty Botanical Gardens has a huge variety of rare plants on display. Notice the distinctly British street names too Charring Cross is the town’s main junction.

Out of town, explore the Nilgiri (Blue Mountains) and sample some of the freshest tea you will ever try when you visit one of the many plantations. Trekkers will enjoy the hike to Doddabetta Peak, the highest in the area, located just north of the city. Further afield, wildlife reserves such as Mudumalai National Park offer the opportunity to spot tigers and other wildlife.

April to June is the most popular time to visit Ooty, as the temperature ranges from cool to mild, a welcome break from the intense heat at sea level. October to March can be chilly, so bring warm clothes if you visit during this period.
